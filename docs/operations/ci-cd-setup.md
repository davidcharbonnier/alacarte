1. **`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`**
   - Your Docker Hub username
   - Example: `davidcharbonnier`

2. **`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`**
   - Docker Hub Access Token with **Read, Write, Delete** permissions
   - How to create:
     1. Go to [Docker Hub Security](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security)
     2. Click "New Access Token"
     3. Name: `alacarte-github-actions`
     4. Permissions: **Read, Write, Delete** (Delete is required for cleanup)
     5. Copy the token immediately (shown only once)

3. **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**
   - ‚úÖ Automatically provided by GitHub Actions (no setup needed)

### Environment Variables

Navigate to: `Settings` ‚Üí `Environments`

#### Create `dev` Environment

Variables:
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`**: Your development API URL
  - Example: `https://alacarte-api-dev-123456.run.app`

#### Create `prod` Environment

Variables:
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`**: Your production API URL
  - Example: `https://alacarte-api-prod-123456.run.app`

## üîÑ Workflows Overview

### 1. PR Snapshot (`pr-snapshot.yml`)

**Trigger:** Every commit on a pull request to `master`

**Environment:** Uses `dev` environment for Admin builds

**What it does:**
- Detects which apps changed (API, Client, Admin) using path filters
- Generates snapshot version: `v0.1.0-pr-123.abc1234` (format: current-version-pr-number.commit-sha)
- Builds only changed apps in parallel:
  - **API:** Docker image with linux/amd64
  - **Admin:** Docker image with Next.js production build, dev API URL
  - **Client:** Flutter APK (debug build with dev configuration)
- Pushes Docker images with two tags:
  - Unique: `{app}:v0.1.0-pr-123.abc1234`
  - Convenience: `{app}:pr-123-latest`
- Uploads Client APK as GitHub Actions artifact
- Comments on PR with available images and manual deployment instructions

**Key Features:**
- Change detection: Only builds affected apps
- Flutter 3.35.4 with Java 17 for Android builds
- Docker BuildKit caching for faster builds
- Parallel execution for speed

**Outputs:**
- Docker images: `davidcharbonnier/alacarte-{app}:{snapshot-version}`
- Convenience tags: `davidcharbonnier/alacarte-{app}:pr-{number}-latest`
- Client APK artifact (30-day retention)

### 2. Cleanup Snapshots (`cleanup-snapshots.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- When a PR is closed (merged or not) - immediate cleanup
- Daily at 2 AM UTC (safety net)
- Manual trigger via `workflow_dispatch`

**What it does:**
1. **Determine what to keep:**
   - Lists all open PRs
   - Identifies last merged PR
   - Creates keep list: open PRs + last merged PR

2. **Parallel Docker cleanup:**
   - For each app (api, admin) independently
   - Lists all Docker Hub tags
   - Deletes tags matching old PR numbers
   - Uses `regctl` for Docker Hub API access

3. **Sequential GitHub cleanup:**
   - Deletes pre-release GitHub releases (must be first)
   - Deletes orphaned git tags (after releases)
   - Deletes old APK artifacts (safety net)

**Retention Policy:**
- ‚úÖ Keep all snapshots from **open PRs** (active development)
- ‚úÖ Keep snapshots from **last merged PR** (rollback capability)
- ‚ùå Delete all other snapshots (old PRs)

**Cleanup Order:**
```
Docker Hub Tags (parallel, independent)
        ‚Üì
GitHub Releases (sequential - first)
        ‚Üì
Git Tags (sequential - after releases)
        ‚Üì
Artifacts (sequential - safety net)
```

### 3. Production Release (`release.yml`)

**Trigger:** Push of git tags matching patterns:
- `v*` - Synchronized release (all apps)
- `api-v*` - API only
- `client-v*` - Client only  
- `admin-v*` - Admin only

**Environment:** Uses `prod` environment for Docker builds

**Versioning:**
- Versions are extracted directly from git tags
- `package.json` files are NOT used for versioning
- Tags created by release-please workflow
- Format: `v0.6.0` or `api-v1.2.3`

**Process:**
When a tag is pushed:
- Determines release type from tag pattern
- Extracts version number from tag (strips prefix and 'v')
- Triggers appropriate build jobs based on tag type:

**Build Jobs:**
1. **Docker Images (API + Admin):**
   - Matrix build for both apps
   - Uses production environment variables
   - Admin gets `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` from prod env
   - Tags: `{app}:v{version}` + `{app}:latest`

2. **Client APK:**
   - Flutter 3.35.4 + Java 17
   - Generates localizations
   - Builds release APK
   - Uploads as artifact

3. **GitHub Releases:**
   - Release-please creates GitHub releases with changelogs
   - Workflow updates releases with deployment information
   - Adds Docker image pull commands
   - Attaches APK for client releases
   - Links to relevant changelogs

**Release Examples:**
```
Synchronized tag: v0.6.0
‚Üí Release: "Platform v0.6.0"
‚Üí Builds: API, Client, Admin all at version 0.6.0
‚Üí Docker tags: api:0.6.0, admin:0.6.0
‚Üí APK: client 0.6.0

App-specific tag: api-v1.2.3  
‚Üí Release: "API v1.2.3"
‚Üí Builds: API only at version 1.2.3
‚Üí Docker tags: api:1.2.3
```

**Outputs:**
- Docker images: `davidcharbonnier/alacarte-{app}:v{version}` + `:latest`
- GitHub releases with tags (combined or per-app)
- Client APK attached to relevant release

## üöÄ Developer Workflow

### Working on a Feature

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/add-wine-support

# 2. Make changes across apps
# ... edit code ...

# 3. Commit and push
git commit -m "feat: add wine support"
git push origin feat/add-wine-support

# 4. Open PR with conventional commit messages
# ‚Üí Snapshot builds automatically trigger
# ‚Üí Wait for comment with image tags

# Example commits:
git commit -m "feat: add wine item type support"
git commit -m "fix: resolve image upload issue"
git commit -m "docs: update wine documentation"
```

### Release Process

```bash
# 1. Merge feature PR to master with conventional commits
# ‚Üí Release-please tracks changes via commits

# 2. Release-please creates/updates release PR
# - Bumps versions in .release-please-manifest.json
# - Updates CHANGELOG.md files
# - Groups all changes since last release

# 3. Review and merge release PR
# - Check version bumps (follows semver)
# - Review CHANGELOG.md updates
# - Verify all commits are included

# 4. Release-please creates git tag automatically
# ‚Üí Tag push triggers release.yml workflow
# ‚Üí Docker images published with version from tag
# ‚Üí GitHub releases updated with artifacts
# ‚Üí APK attached to releases
```

## üß™ Manual QA Deployment

After snapshot build completes:

```bash
# Deploy API snapshot
gcloud run deploy alacarte-api-qa \
  --image=davidcharbonnier/alacarte-api:v0.1.0-pr-123.abc1234 \
  --region=northamerica-northeast1

# Deploy Admin snapshot
gcloud run deploy alacarte-admin-qa \
  --image=davidcharbonnier/alacarte-admin:v0.1.0-pr-123.abc1234 \
  --region=northamerica-northeast1

# Download Client APK
# Go to PR ‚Üí Checks ‚Üí build-client ‚Üí Artifacts
# Or use GitHub CLI:
gh run download <run-id> -n client-apk-<version>
```

## üìä Monitoring

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Snapshot Build Failures

**Issue:** Docker build fails
- Check Dockerfile exists in `apps/{app}/`
- Verify Docker Hub credentials are set
- Review build logs for specific errors
- Check if base images are accessible

**Issue:** Flutter APK build fails
- Verify Flutter version 3.35.4 is available
- Check if `pubspec.yaml` dependencies resolve
- Ensure localization files are valid
- Review Java 17 setup logs

**Issue:** Admin build fails
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set in dev environment
- Check Next.js build errors in logs
- Ensure Dockerfile has `prod` target

### Cleanup Not Working

**Issue:** Docker tags not deleted
- Verify `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` has **Delete** permissions
- Check if `regctl` installed successfully
- Review cleanup logs for API errors
- Ensure Docker Hub is accessible

**Issue:** GitHub releases not deleted
- Check if releases reference git tags (must delete releases first)
- Verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` has write permissions
- Review error messages in cleanup logs

### Release Issues

**Issue:** Release-please PR not created
- Verify conventional commits exist since last release
- Check release-please workflow logs
- Ensure commits are pushed to `master` branch
- Verify `.release-please-manifest.json` is valid

**Issue:** Version not detected correctly
- Check git tag format matches patterns (v*, api-v*, etc.)
- Verify tag was pushed (not just created locally)
- Review release.yml workflow logs for version extraction
- Ensure tag follows semantic versioning (e.g., v0.6.0)

**Issue:** Production build fails
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in prod environment
- Verify Dockerfile builds locally
- Review build logs for specific errors

## üìù Best Practices

### Commit Message Guidelines
- Use conventional commits (enforced by commitlint)
- Commit types trigger version bumps:
  - `feat:` ‚Üí minor version bump (new features)
  - `fix:` ‚Üí patch version bump (bug fixes)
  - `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` ‚Üí major version bump
- Other types (docs, chore, refactor) don't trigger releases
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Example: `feat: add wine item type support`

### PR Practices
- Keep PRs focused and small
- Test snapshot builds before requesting review
- Deploy to QA manually if needed
- Ensure all checks pass before merge

### Release Management
- Batch multiple features into one release
- Review release-please PR carefully
- Don't merge release PR until ready for deployment
- Monitor release workflow completion after tag creation
- Version comes from git tag, not package.json

### Cleanup Maintenance
- Cleanup runs automatically (no action needed)
- Check cleanup logs if storage concerns arise
- Last merged PR kept for emergency rollback
