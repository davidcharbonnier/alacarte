## üìù Notes

### Item Type Pattern

All item endpoints follow the pattern:
- `POST /api/:itemType/new` - Create
- `GET /api/:itemType/all` - List
- `GET /api/:itemType/:id` - Read
- `PUT /api/:itemType/:id` - Update
- `DELETE /api/:itemType/:id` - Delete

Supported item types: `cheese`, `gin`, `wine`

### Image Endpoints

Image upload/delete endpoints work for all item types:
- `POST /api/:itemType/:id/image` - Upload
- `DELETE /api/:itemType/:id/image` - Delete

Any authenticated user can upload/delete images (collaborative platform).

### Privacy Model

Ratings are private by default:
- Only visible to author
- Can be shared with specific users
- Community stats are anonymous aggregates

See [Privacy Model](/docs/features/privacy-model.md) for details.
