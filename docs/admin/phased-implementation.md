## Phase 1: Core Admin with Generic Architecture âœ…

**Goal:** Build generic config system and implement item/user management

**Status:** Complete

### Completed âœ…

**Generic Config System:**
- Item type configuration structure
- Generic components (table, detail, delete impact, seed with validation)
- Dynamic routing with [itemType] parameter
- API client factory for type-safe operations
- Data transformation (GORM to JavaScript)
- Dynamic dashboard statistics

**Item Management:**
- Cheese fully functional (list, detail, delete with cascade, seed with validation)
- Gin fully functional (list, detail, delete with cascade, seed with validation)
- Both use generic components via configuration
- Two-step seeding process (validate then import)

**User Management:**
- User list page with admin badges
- User detail page with full profile information
- User delete impact assessment
- Delete user with cascade
- Promote/demote admin privileges
- Initial admin protection (cannot demote initial admin)
- Dashboard displays real-time user count
- Header "My Account" navigation to own profile

**Authentication & Security:**
- NextAuth.js v5 integration with Google OAuth
- Backend JWT exchange and validation
- Admin role verification at login (database flag + initial admin email)
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
- Server-side route protection via middleware
- TanStack Query state management
- Secure session storage (httpOnly cookies)
- GORM to JavaScript data transformation in auth session

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker development and production builds
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Semantic versioning with GitVersion
- Automated Docker Hub releases
- ESLint configuration for production builds
- Security hardening (removed tech stack disclosure, disabled X-Powered-By header)

### Deliverables âœ…

- Generic config system for all item types
- Cheese and gin management complete
- User management complete with admin controls
- All backend admin endpoints integrated
- Admin role verification enabled
- Production-ready deployment pipeline

**Phase 1: 100% Complete**
