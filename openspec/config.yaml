    - All commits MUST follow conventional commit format with required scopes (api, client, admin, deps, ci, docs, release).
    - "Branch naming: feat/, fix/, refactor/, docs/, chore/."
    - Follow existing patterns and keep code DRY.
    - Add comments only for complex logic.
    - Group tasks by expertise (backend, frontend, devops)
  specs:
    - Update documentation in `docs/` when adding features or changing behavior.
